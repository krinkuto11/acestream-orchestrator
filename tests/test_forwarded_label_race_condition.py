"""
Test to verify the fix for the forwarded engine label race condition.

This test validates that during sequential provisioning of multiple containers,
only the first container receives the forwarded=true label, and all subsequent
containers receive forwarded=false.

The bug was that all containers were getting forwarded=true because the state
was not updated until after all provisioning completed.
