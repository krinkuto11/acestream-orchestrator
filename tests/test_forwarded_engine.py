"""
Test forwarded engine functionality for Gluetun port assignment.

This test validates that:
1. Only one engine is marked as forwarded at a time
2. The forwarded engine receives the P2P port
3. Non-forwarded engines do not receive the P2P port
4. When the forwarded engine is removed, a new one is created by autoscaler
