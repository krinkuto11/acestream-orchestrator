"""
Test to validate the fix for slow orchestrator startup due to Gluetun health check delays.

The issue was:
1. Orchestrator starts -> cleanup -> start Gluetun monitor -> immediately call ensure_minimum()
2. ensure_minimum() tries to create 3 engines immediately
3. Each engine creation waits 30 seconds for Gluetun to become healthy
4. Total delay: 3 * 30 = 90 seconds of blocking waits during startup

The fix:
1. Wait for Gluetun to become healthy during startup (max 60s, async)
2. Only then call ensure_minimum() to provision engines
3. Reduce individual engine timeout from 30s to 5s since Gluetun should already be healthy
