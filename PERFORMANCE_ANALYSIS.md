# Performance Degradation Analysis

## Executive Summary

After fixing the capacity calculation bug, I've conducted a deeper analysis of the logs to identify additional performance issues. The system exhibits several concerning patterns that contribute to performance degradation under load.

## Key Findings

### 1. High Stream Failure Rate (60% failure rate)

**Evidence:**
- Total stream failures: 151 out of ~253 stream operations
- 96 instances of `fetch_failed` (engines unable to fetch stream metadata)
- 55 instances of `start_stream_failed` (streams failed to start after fetch)

**Impact:**
- Wasted resources on failed operations
- Increased latency as retries are attempted
- Poor user experience with high failure rates

**Pattern:**
Stream failures show two distinct failure modes:
1. `fetch_failed`: Engine cannot retrieve stream information from the Acestream network
2. `start_stream_failed`: Engine fetched metadata but failed to actually start the stream

### 2. Extreme Request Latency (avg 42.4 seconds)

**Evidence:**
- 134 slow requests logged in stress log
- Average duration: **42.38 seconds**
- Worst case: **201+ seconds** (over 3 minutes)
- Many requests in the 30-90 second range

**Sample slow requests:**
```
165.3s at 241s elapsed
168.8s at 269s elapsed  
201.3s at 292s elapsed
```

**Impact:**
- Unacceptable user-facing latency
- Timeout risks for client connections
- Resource exhaustion from long-running requests

### 3. Engine Instability and Thrashing

**Evidence from orchestrator health logs:**

```
Time    Engines  Healthy  Unhealthy
376s    7        3        4          ← Major instability
406s    10       8        2
436s    10       5        5          ← Half engines unhealthy
466s    10       10       0          ← Recovery
```

**Pattern Analysis:**
- Engines fluctuate between 7-14 instances
- Periodic health issues affecting 50%+ of engines
- Rapid cycling between healthy/unhealthy states
- Auto-scaling appears to create instability

**Impact:**
- System thrashing between scaling up and down
- Wasted provisioning cycles
- Inconsistent capacity availability

### 4. Slow Engine Selection Under Load

**Evidence:**
- Normal engine selection: 46-76ms
- Under stress: 100-250ms
- Some outliers at 400ms+

**Timestamps showing degradation:**
```
411.18s: 247ms
411.19s: 249ms
411.20s: 236ms
411.21s: 240ms
```

**Cause:**
Multiple concurrent requests all trying to select best engine simultaneously, likely causing contention.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues

#### 1. **Acestream Network/P2P Issues**
The high rate of `fetch_failed` suggests:
- Content IDs may be invalid/unreachable
- P2P network connectivity problems
- DHT lookup failures
- Possible rate limiting from Acestream network

#### 2. **Engine Resource Exhaustion**
Pattern of engines becoming unhealthy suggests:
- Engines running out of memory/disk space
- Too many concurrent streams per engine
- Cache/buffer overflow
- Possible memory leaks in Acestream engine

#### 3. **Aggressive Auto-Scaling**
The fluctuation pattern (7→14→10 engines) indicates:
- Scale-up triggers too sensitive
- Scale-down happening too quickly
- No stabilization period between scaling actions
- Creates "thrashing" that wastes resources

#### 4. **Lock Contention in Engine Selection**
The spike in engine selection latency under load suggests:
- Shared state causing lock contention
- No caching of selection results
- Sequential processing of concurrent requests

## Recommendations

### High Priority (Performance Critical)

1. **Implement Request Timeout and Circuit Breaker**
   - Add 30s timeout for stream start operations
   - Implement circuit breaker for failing content IDs
   - Fast-fail known bad content instead of retrying

2. **Add Engine Selection Caching**
   - Cache "best engine" selection for 1-2 seconds
   - Reduce lock contention during concurrent requests
   - Use read-write locks instead of exclusive locks

3. **Stabilize Auto-Scaling**
   - Add cooldown period between scaling actions (e.g., 60s)
   - Require sustained load before scaling up
   - Implement hysteresis to prevent thrashing
   - Set minimum engine lifetime before scale-down

4. **Implement Engine Health Monitoring**
   - Add resource usage monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
   - Automatically restart unhealthy engines
   - Implement graceful degradation when engines fail

### Medium Priority

5. **Stream Retry Strategy**
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Track failure rate per content ID
   - Block content IDs with >80% failure rate

6. **Engine Capacity Limits**
   - Enforce max concurrent streams per engine (e.g., 3-5)
   - Prevent resource exhaustion
   - Better distribution of load

7. **Optimize Provisioning**
   - Pool pre-warmed engines for faster allocation
   - Reduce provisioning time from ~280ms to <100ms
   - Implement lazy initialization where possible

### Low Priority (Nice to Have)

8. **Request Queuing**
   - Queue requests when at capacity
   - Provide queue position/ETA to clients
   - Prevent thundering herd

9. **Metrics and Alerting**
   - Alert on >30% failure rate
   - Alert on >10s average latency
   - Alert on engine health issues

10. **Load Shedding**
    - Reject requests when system is overloaded
    - Return 503 with Retry-After header
    - Protect system from cascading failures

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Current | Target | Critical Threshold |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| Stream Failure Rate | 60% | <10% | >30% |
| Avg Request Latency | 42s | <5s | >15s |
| P95 Request Latency | ~90s | <10s | >30s |
| Engine Health Rate | 50-100% | >95% | <80% |
| Engine Selection Time | 50-250ms | <50ms | >100ms |

## Monitoring Recommendations

Implement continuous monitoring for:
- Stream success/failure rates by content ID
- Request latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Engine health status and transitions
- Auto-scaling events and timing
- Resource utilization per engine

## Conclusion

The capacity calculation bug was causing incorrect reporting, but the underlying performance issues are more severe:

1. **60% stream failure rate** is the most critical issue - requires immediate investigation
2. **42s average latency** makes the service nearly unusable under load
3. **Engine thrashing** wastes resources and creates instability
4. **Lock contention** limits scalability under concurrent load

These issues compound each other - failures trigger retries, retries cause load, load triggers scaling, scaling creates instability, instability causes more failures.

**Recommended Next Steps:**
1. Fix stream failure root cause (network/content issues)
2. Implement timeouts and circuit breakers
3. Stabilize auto-scaling with cooldowns
4. Add engine selection caching
