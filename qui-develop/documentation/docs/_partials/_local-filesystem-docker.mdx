:::warning[Docker: Local Filesystem Access]
Several qui features require access to the same filesystem paths that qBittorrent uses (orphan scan, hardlinks, reflinks, automations).

Mount the same paths qBittorrent uses - paths must match exactly:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /config:/config
  - /data/torrents:/data/torrents  # Must match qBittorrent's path
```

After mounting, enable **Local Filesystem Access** on each instance in qui's Instance Settings.
