# Acexy Proxy Orchestrator Integration Improvements

This document describes the improvements made to the Acexy proxy to better integrate with the acestream-orchestrator, based on the recommendations in `prompt.md`.

## Overview

The proxy has been enhanced with better reliability, error handling, and user experience when working with the orchestrator. All improvements focus on making minimal changes while maximizing impact.

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. Health Check Before Provisioning ✅

**What was added:**
- New `CanProvision()` method that checks if orchestrator can provision engines
- Pre-provisioning health check in `SelectBestEngine()` to avoid unnecessary provision attempts
- Returns clear error messages when provisioning is blocked (e.g., "VPN disconnected")

**Code location:** `acexy/orchestrator_events.go`

**Benefits:**
- Avoids wasting time attempting to provision when VPN is down
- Provides immediate feedback to users about why provisioning cannot happen
- Reduces load on orchestrator during known failure conditions

### 2. Proper Error Handling for HTTP Status Codes ✅

**What was added:**
- HTTP 503 (Service Unavailable) treated as temporary failure - can be retried
- HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) treated as permanent failure - no retry
- Detailed error messages extracted from orchestrator response
- User-facing error messages distinguish between VPN issues and circuit breaker failures

**Code location:** `acexy/orchestrator_events.go` (ProvisionAcestream), `acexy/proxy.go` (HandleStream)

**Benefits:**
- Intelligent retry logic based on error type
- Users get specific error messages explaining the problem
- Reduces unnecessary retries for permanent failures

### 3. Periodic Health Monitoring ✅

**What was added:**
- Background goroutine that checks `/orchestrator/status` every 30 seconds
- `OrchestratorHealth` struct with mutex-protected state
- `StartHealthMonitor()` method that runs continuously
- Thread-safe access to health status via `CanProvision()`

**Code location:** `acexy/orchestrator_events.go`

**Benefits:**
- Proactive monitoring of orchestrator and VPN status
- Health status always available without blocking
- Early detection of orchestrator issues

### 4. Improved User-Facing Error Messages ✅

**What was added:**
- Specific HTTP 503 errors for VPN disconnection: "Service temporarily unavailable: VPN connection required"
- Specific HTTP 503 errors for circuit breaker: "Service temporarily unavailable: Too many failures, please retry later"
- Generic provisioning blocked errors with reason included

**Code location:** `acexy/proxy.go` (HandleStream)

**Benefits:**
- Users understand why their stream failed
- Clear distinction between temporary and permanent failures
- Better debugging for administrators

### 5. Reduced Wait Time and Engine Verification ✅

**What was changed:**
- Wait time reduced from 10 seconds to 5 seconds after provisioning
- Engine verification added - checks if engine appears in orchestrator's engine list
- Additional 5 second wait if engine not found (total max 10 seconds)
- Early return if engine found in first check

**Code location:** `acexy/orchestrator_events.go` (SelectBestEngine)

**Benefits:**
- Faster stream startup when engine appears quickly
- Verification ensures engine is tracked by orchestrator
- More efficient use of time

### 6. Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff ✅

**What was added:**
- New `ProvisionWithRetry()` method with configurable max retries
- Exponential backoff: 2s, 4s, 8s, etc.
- Smart retry logic: only retries temporary failures (503), not permanent (500)
- Used in `SelectBestEngine()` with 3 retry attempts

**Code location:** `acexy/orchestrator_events.go`

**Benefits:**
- Handles transient failures gracefully
- Reduces impact of temporary VPN disconnections
- Avoids hammering orchestrator with immediate retries

## Testing

Comprehensive tests were added for all new functionality:

### Test Coverage

1. **TestCanProvision** - Verifies health check logic works correctly
2. **TestUpdateHealth** - Verifies health status updates from orchestrator
3. **TestProvisionWithRetry** - Verifies retry logic for temporary failures (503)
4. **TestProvisionWithRetryPermanentFailure** - Verifies no retries for permanent failures (500)
5. **TestSelectBestEngineProvisioningBlocked** - Verifies provisioning blocked when health check fails
6. **TestSelectBestEngineLoadBalancing** - Existing test for load balancing logic (unchanged)

All tests pass successfully.

## API Impact

### No Breaking Changes

All changes are backward compatible:
- Existing proxy functionality remains unchanged
- New features only activate when orchestrator integration is enabled
- Fallback to direct engine connection works as before

### New Functionality

Users will now experience:
- Better error messages explaining failures
- Faster stream startup (5s vs 10s in successful cases)
- Automatic retry of temporary failures
- Protection against provisioning when VPN is down

## Configuration

No new configuration variables are required. The improvements use existing:
- `ACEXY_ORCH_URL` - Orchestrator base URL
- `ACEXY_ORCH_APIKEY` - Orchestrator API key
- `ACEXY_CONTAINER_ID` - Container ID for event reporting
- `ACEXY_MAX_STREAMS_PER_ENGINE` - Maximum streams per engine

## Performance Impact

- Health monitoring adds minimal overhead (one HTTP request every 30 seconds)
- Retry logic only activates on failures
- Reduced wait time improves user experience in successful cases
- No impact on memory usage

## Code Quality

- All new code follows existing patterns and style
- Comprehensive test coverage added
- Thread-safe access to shared state using mutexes
- Proper error handling and logging throughout
- Clear comments explaining behavior

## Future Considerations

Potential future enhancements (not implemented):
1. Make health check interval configurable
2. Add metrics for provisioning retry attempts
3. Implement circuit breaker on proxy side
4. Add caching of orchestrator status

## Summary

All six improvements from `prompt.md` have been successfully implemented with minimal code changes and maximum benefit. The proxy now provides:

✅ Better reliability through health checks and retry logic
✅ Better user experience through clear error messages
✅ Better performance through reduced wait times
✅ Better monitoring through background health checks

The changes are production-ready and fully tested.
